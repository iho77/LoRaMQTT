# LoRaMQTT

Quick gateway from LoRa to MQTT for esp32. Compiles as Eclipse esp32-idf project with esp32-arduino as extra component 

This is a port from code initial written in Arduino IDE so it looks lilte bit strange to compile arduino style code as esp32-idf. Need to be refactored as pure esp32-idf app
